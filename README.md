### Sparkle The Fish (Mastodon Bot)

Sparkle is the result of a [conversation](Original-Conversation.md) I had while I was board on a trans-atlantic flight with an AI model running on my computer back home that got completely off the rails. It got so nutty that I had to distill the conversation into a system prompt (using a different AI model) and put it online.


### Architecture
This application is a .NET-based Mastodon bot designed to periodically post these generated facts to a designated account, and reply to comments. It utilizes the Mastodon API for posting and is built with the goal of being a fun, albeit peculiar, presence on the fediverse.
